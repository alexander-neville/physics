#+TITLE: Physics Practical

Data obtained during physics practicals often needs to be processed. Calculating the averages and uncertainties of each value in a large data-set can be tedious. I have written some scripts to make handling the data much faster.

The example given here is an experiment to determine the relationship between /pressure/ and the /volume/ occupied by a gas.

* Running the Project

*NB.* /instructions given for linux/unix systems/

In a virtual-environment (or globally) install the dependencies with this command:

#+begin_src shell

python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

#+end_src

Entry point for the project is =app.py=, so run like this:

#+begin_src shell

python3 app.py

#+end_src
