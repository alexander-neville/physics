#+TITLE: Physics Practicals

[[./data/plots/capacitor.png]]

This repository contains a set of scripts which process experimental data obtained during my physics lessons. The raw data, collected during class, is stored in CSV format.

* Methodology

For each experiment conducted, the general procedure follows these steps:

1. load the raw data into the program
2. process raw data to mitigate/reduce uncertainty
3. manipulate raw data to establish a trend
4. plot any such relationship on a graph
5. export the processed data to CSV

* Project Structure

The =experiments/= directory contains the scripts that do the data processing (1 per experiment). The data that these scripts work on is stored in the =data/= directory, which contains 3 subdirectories:

- =in/= - contains the raw data
- =out/= - processed data is written to this directory
- =plots/= - generated plots and figures are saved to this directory

Common among all experiments is the /I/O/ of data. This is handled by a set of functions which are packaged separately to the individual experiments. Additionally, this repository contains some utilities for debugging, introspecting variables at run time. These utilities reside in the unimaginatively named =functions= package.

* Deployment

Install the specified dependencies (you may want to create/start a virtual environment first):

#+begin_src shell
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
#+end_src

Edit the =config.py= file in the specified place to make sure that the scripts can find the input data.

#+begin_src python
import os
data_dir = os.path.expanduser('~') + "/repos/physics/data/" # << edit this
in_dir = data_dir+"in/"
out_dir = data_dir+"out/"
plot_dir = data_dir+"plots/"
#+end_src

From the root of the project, invoke python on any of the scripts in the =experiments/= directory. This will populate the data directory with processed data and a plot of the results.
